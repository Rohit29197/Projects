true note assume something false prove true basic scientific principle example '' course bible true nobody prove otherwise '' `` course telepathy psychic phenomenon exist nobody show proof real '' note fallacy apply court law one generally assume innocent proven guilty also scientific investigation know event would produce certain evidence occur absence evidence validly use infer event occur example '' flood described bible would require enormous volume water present earth earth tenth much water even count frozen ice pole therefore flood occur '' science validly assume lack evidence
